BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE ART OF THE WESTERN WORLD – NUBIAN ART, PP. 9-13 
Which of the following reasons BEST explains why modern art historians focus more on ancient Egyptian art than ancient West African art?
Most ancient West African civilizations intentionally destroyed their artifacts to symbolize life’s transience. 
Egypt’s climate allows ancient art to be preserved for much longer than in West Africa. 
Modern art historians consider ancient Egyptian art to be objectively higher in quality than ancient West African art. 
Art historians have historically considered ancient Egyptian art to underly Greek and Roman traditions. 
Ancient Egyptian art has lasted in greater quantity since it is secure within royal tombs that were almost always impervious to robbery. 
B
Art historians often struggle to study ancient civilizations that operated in climates that were not conducive to the preservation of cultural artifacts. This is certainly the case in much of West Africa, where high levels of humidity hurt the chances of art surviving into the present. In contrast, the dry climate of Egypt is incredibly well-suited to long- term preservation.
